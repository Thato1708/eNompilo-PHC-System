# eNompilo-PHC-System
This is a PHC system that we developed as part of our university project.

The system  was developed using C# â€˜s ASP.Net MVC framework and MS SQL, and it has the basic CRUD functionality with regard to managing appointments. It also has extra features like:

1. Tracking vaccine inventory
2. Assistance with breathing exercises for when a patient has a panic attack under the counselling subsystem.
3. A messaging functionality under the contraceptives subsystem.
4. A video recap page under the Specialised Medical Procedures subsystem.
5. A GBV-specific FAQ section under the GBV subsystem.
